### Professional engagements

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Embedded Systems, at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). As a proud member of [SpaceLab](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc), I'm actively engaged in developing firmware (primarily in C/C++) and hardware tailored for CubeSats. Specifically, I'm contributing to the advancement of the [FloripaSat-2 platform](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10078027), a pivotal project slated for deployment in various SpaceLab missions. Additionally, I'm actively involved in shaping and creating novel platforms for future endeavors.
