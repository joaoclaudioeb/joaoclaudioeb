### Professional engagements

Currently, I am a MSc student in Electrical Engineering, focusing on Embedded Systems, at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). 
I am a member of [SpaceLab](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc), working on firmware (mostly in C/C++) and hardware for CubeSats. 
I am involved in the development of the [FloripaSat-2 platform](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10078027), which will be used in several SpaceLab's missions, as well as in the creation of new ones to come.
